                    <h2 className='text-rose-800 font-bold'>When should you use node.js and when should you use mongodb?</h2>
                    <p className='text-rose-500'>MongoDB and NodeJS are two different technologies. MonogDB is a database system which gives you a chance to proficiently store documents in a database and to execute actions like data updates, or to search documents by some conditionsâ€™ If your application needs the ability to insistently store data in a way that you can proficiently query or update it later, then you  can use a form of database like MongoDB. NodeJS's concern is to especially execute your application. Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime collection that offers you basic programming tools/maintenance and can accumulate and/or interpret your code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming language.</p>
                    <h2 className='text-rose-800 font-bold'>Differences between SQL and NOSQL databases?</h2>
                    <p className='text-rose-500'>There are a lot of databases used today in the industry. Some are SQL databases, some are NoSQL databases.
